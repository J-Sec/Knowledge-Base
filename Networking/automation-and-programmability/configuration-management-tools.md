# Configuration Management Tools

Configuration management tools make use of RESTful API requests to automate tasks and can scale across thousands of devices. Configuration management tools maintain the characteristics of a system, or network, for consistency. These are some characteristics of the network that administrators benefit from automating:

* Software and version control
* Device attributes such as names, addressing, and security
* Protocol configurations
* ACL configurations



Configuration management tools typically include automation and orchestration:

* Automation is when a tool automatically performs a task on a system
* Orchestration is the arranging of the automated tasks that results in a coordinate process or workflow.



There are several tools available to make configuration management easier:

* Ansible
* Chef
* Puppet
* SaltStack
