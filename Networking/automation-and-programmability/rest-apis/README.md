## Open, Internal, and Partner APIs

An important consideration when developing an API is the distinction between open, internal, and partner APIs:

* **Open APIs or Public APIs** - These APIs are publicly available and can be used with no restrictions. The International Space Station API is an example of a Public API. Because these APIs are public, many API providers, such as Google Maps, require the user to get a free key, or token, prior to using the API. This is to help control the number of API requests they receive and process. Search the internet for a list of public APIs.
* **Internal or Private APIs** - These are APIs that are used by an organisation or company to access data and services for internal use only. An example of an internal API is allowing authorised salespeople access to internal sales data on their mobile devices.
* **Partner APIs** - These are APIs that are used between a company and its business partners or contractors to facilitate business between them. The business partner must have a license or other form of permission to use the API. A travel service using an airlineâ€™s API is an example of a partner API.

## Types of Web Service APIs

A web service is a service that is available over the internet, using the World Wide Web. There are four types of web service APIs:

* Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP)
* Representational State Transfer (REST)
* eXtensible Markup Language-Remote Procedure Call (XML-RPC)
* JavaScript Object Notation-Remote Procedure Call (JSON-RPC)
