# TCP/IP Networking Model

{% hint style="info" %}
The <mark style="color:blue;">**TCP/IP networking model**</mark> is a five-layer framework that standardises network communication, consisting of the Physical, Data-Link, Network, Transport, and Application layers to enable reliable data transmission across interconnected networks.
{% endhint %}

The **TCP/IP model** can be viewed as a framework built upon a collection of **RFCs (Request for Comments)**, which define the protocols and standards that operate at each of its layers.



Five layers of the TCP/IP Model:

* [**Physical Layer**](physical-layer.md): deals with the physical medium and hardware, such as cables, switches, and electrical signals.
* [**Data-Link Layer**](data-link-layer.md): **h**andles framing, addressing (MAC), and error detection for communication between directly connected devices.
* [**Network Layer**](network-layer.md): manages addressing, routing, and packet forwarding using protocols like **IP** (Internet Protocol).&#x20;
* [**Transport Layer**](transport-layer.md): ensures reliable or connectionless data delivery using protocols like **TCP** (reliable) and **UDP** (unreliable).
* [**Application Layer**](application-layer.md): provides services for end-user applications, such as HTTP, FTP, DNS, and SMTP.
