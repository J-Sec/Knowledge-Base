# Switch Hardware

## Switch Platforms

**Campus LAN Switches**

* To scale network performance in an enterprise LAN, there are core, distribution, access, and compact switches.&#x20;
* These switch platforms vary from fanless switches with eight fixed ports to 13-blade switches supporting hundreds of ports.&#x20;
* Campus LAN switch platforms include the Cisco 2960, 3560, 3650, 3850, 4500, 6500, and 6800 Series.



**Cloud-Managed Switches**

* The Cisco Meraki cloud-managed access switches enable virtual stacking of switches.&#x20;
* They monitor and configure thousands of switch ports over the web, without the intervention of onsite IT staff.



**Data Centre Switches**

* A data centre should be built based on switches that promote infrastructure scalability, operational continuity, and transport flexibility.&#x20;
* The data centre switch platforms include the Cisco Nexus Series switches.



**Service Provider Switches**

* Service provider switches fall under two categories:&#x20;
  * aggregation switches
  * Ethernet access switches
* Aggregation switches are carrier-grade Ethernet switches that aggregate traffic at the edge of a network
* Service provider Ethernet access switches feature application intelligence, unified services, virtualisation, integrated security, and simplified management.



**Virtual Networking**

* Cisco Nexus virtual networking switch platforms provide secure multi-tenant services by adding virtualisation intelligence technology to the data centre network.



## Switch Form Factors

**Fixed Configuration Switches**

* Features and options on fixed configuration switches are limited to those that originally come with the switch.



**Modular Configuration Switches**

* The chassis on modular switches accept field-replaceable line cards.



**Stackable Configuration Switches**

* Special cables are used to connect stackable switches that allow them to effectively operate as one large switch



**Thickness**

* The thickness of the switch, which is expressed in the number of rack units, is also important for switches that are mounted in a rack.&#x20;

## Port Density

* The port density of a switch refers to the number of ports available on a single switch.
* Fixed configuration switches support a variety of port density configurations.
* Modular switches can support very high port densities through the addition of multiple switchport line cards.

## Forwarding Rates

* Forwarding rates define the processing capabilities of a switch by rating how much data the switch can process per second.
* Wire speed is the data rate that each Ethernet port on the switch is capable of attaining. Data rates can be 100 Mbps, 1 Gbps, 10 Gbps, or 100 Gbps.

## Power Over Ethernet (PoE)

* Power over Ethernet (PoE) allows the switch to deliver power to a device over the existing Ethernet cabling.&#x20;
* This feature can be used by IP phones and some wireless access points, allowing them to be installed anywhere that there is an Ethernet cable.

## Multilayer Switching

* Multilayer switches are typically deployed in the core and distribution layers of an organisation's switched network.&#x20;
* Multilayer switches are characterised by their ability to build a routing table, support a few routing protocols, and forward IP packets at a rate close to that of Layer 2 forwarding.
* Multilayer switches often support specialised hardware, such as application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). ASICs along with dedicated software data structures can streamline the forwarding of IP packets independent of the CPU.
