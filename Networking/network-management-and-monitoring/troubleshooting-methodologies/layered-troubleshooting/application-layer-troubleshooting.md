# Application Layer Troubleshooting

Most of the application layer protocols provide user services.&#x20;

Application layer protocols are typically used for network management, file transfer, distributed file services, terminal emulation, and email. New user services are often added, such as VPNs and VoIP.

A problem at the application layer can result in unreachable or unusable resources when the physical, data link, network, and transport layers are functional.&#x20;

It is possible to have full network connectivity, but the application simply cannot provide data.

Another type of problem at the application layer occurs when the physical, data link, network, and transport layers are functional, but the data transfer and requests for network services from a single network service or application do not meet the normal expectations of a user.
