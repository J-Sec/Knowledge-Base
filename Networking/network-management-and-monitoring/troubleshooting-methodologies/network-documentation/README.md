# Network Documentation

Common network documentation includes the following:

* Physical and logical network topology diagrams
* Network device documentation that records all pertinent device information
* Network performance baseline documentation

All network documentation should be kept in a single location, either as hard copy or on the network on a protected server. Backup documentation should be maintained and kept in a separate location.
