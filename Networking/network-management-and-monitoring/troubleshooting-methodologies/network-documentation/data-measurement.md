# Data Measurement

When documenting the network, it is often necessary to gather information directly from routers and switches. Obvious useful network documentation commands include **ping**, **traceroute**, and **telnet,** as well as **show** commands.

Manual data collection using **show** commands on individual network devices is extremely time consuming and is not a scalable solution.

Sophisticated network management software is typically used to baseline large and complex networks. These software packages enable administrators to automatically create and review reports, compare current performance levels with historical observations, automatically identify performance problems, and create alerts for applications that do not provide expected levels of service.
