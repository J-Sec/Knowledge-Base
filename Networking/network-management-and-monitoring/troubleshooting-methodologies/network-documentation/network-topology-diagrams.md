# Network Topology Diagrams

{% hint style="info" %}
<mark style="color:blue;">**Network topology diagrams**</mark> keep track of the location, function, and status of devices on the network.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

There are two types of network topology diagrams:

* physical topology
* logical topology

## Physical Topology

* Shows the physical layout of the devices connected to the network
* Information recorded on the physical topology typically includes the following:
  * Device name
  * Device location (address, room number, rack location)
  * Interface and ports used
  * Cable type

## Logical Topology

* Illustrates how devices are logically connected to the network
* Symbols are used to represent network components, such as routers, switches, servers, and hosts
* Connections between multiple sites may be shown, but do not represent actual physical locations
* Information recorded on a logical network topology may include the following:
  * Device identifiers
  * IP addresses and prefix lengths
  * Interface identifiers
  * Routing protocols / static routes
  * Layer 2 information (i.e., VLANs, trunks, EtherChannels)
