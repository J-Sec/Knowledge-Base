**Note:** Although the **debug** command is an important tool for gathering symptoms, it generates a large amount of console message traffic and the performance of a network device can be noticeably affected.&#x20;

If the **debug** must be performed during normal working hours, warn network users that a troubleshooting effort is underway, and that network performance may be affected.&#x20;

Remember to disable debugging when you are done.
