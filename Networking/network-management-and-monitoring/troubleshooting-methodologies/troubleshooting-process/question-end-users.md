# Question End Users

In most cases, additional information is required to fully understand a problem. This usually involves interacting with the affected user to discover the “who”, “what”, and “when” of the problem.

The following recommendations should be employed when communicate with user:

* Speak at a technical level they can understand and avoid using complex terminology.
* Always listen or read carefully what the user is saying. Taking notes can be helpful when documenting a complex problem.
* Always be considerate and empathise with users while letting them know you will help them solve their problem. Users reporting a problem may be under stress and anxious to resolve the problem as quickly as possible.

When interviewing the user, guide the conversation and use effective questioning techniques to quickly ascertain the problem. For instance, use open questions (i.e., requires detailed response) and closed questions (i.e., yes, no, or single word answers) to discover important facts about the network problem.

When done interviewing the user, repeat your understanding of the problem to the user to ensure that you both agree on the problem being reported.
