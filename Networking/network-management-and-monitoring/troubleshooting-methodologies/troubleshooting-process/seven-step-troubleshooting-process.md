Notice how some steps interconnect. This is because, some technicians may be able to jump between steps based on their level of experience.

#### Define the Problem

* Problems are usually identified by a symptom (e.g., the network is slow or has stopped working).&#x20;
* Network symptoms may appear in many different forms, including alerts from the network management system, console messages, and user complaints.
* While gathering symptoms, it is important to ask questions and investigate the issue in order to localise the problem to a smaller range of possibilities.

#### Gather Information

* Targets (i.e., hosts, devices) to be investigated must be identified, access to the target devices must be obtained, and information gathered
* The technician may gather and document more symptoms, depending on the characteristics that are identified
* If the problem is outside the boundary of the organisationâ€™s control (e.g., lost internet connectivity outside of the autonomous system), contact an administrator for the external system before gathering additional network symptoms

#### Analyse Information

* Possible causes must be identified.&#x20;
* The gathered information is interpreted and analysed using network documentation, network baselines, searching organisational knowledge bases, searching the internet, and talking with other technicians.

#### Eliminate Possible Causes

* If multiple causes are identified, then the list must be reduced by progressively eliminating possible causes to eventually identify the most probable cause
* Troubleshooting experience is extremely valuable to quickly eliminate causes and identify the most probable cause

#### Propose Hypothesis

* When the most probable cause has been identified, a solution must be formulated
* At this stage, troubleshooting experience is very valuable when proposing a plan

#### Test Hypothesis

* Before testing the solution, it is important to assess the impact and urgency of the problem
* The severity of the problem should be weighed against the impact of the solution
* Sometimes, a workaround can be created until the actual problem is resolved
* Create a rollback plan identifying how to quickly reverse a solution. This may prove to be necessary if the solution fails
* Implement the solution and verify that it has solved the problem. Sometimes a solution introduces an unexpected problem. Therefore, it is important that a solution be thoroughly verified before proceeding to the next step.
* If the solution fails, the attempted solution is documented and the changes are removed. The technician must now go back to the Gathering Information step and isolate the issue

#### Solve the Problem

* Inform the users and anyone involved in the troubleshooting process that the problem has been resolved
* Other IT team members should be informed of the solution
* Appropriate documentation of the cause and the fix will assist other support technicians in preventing and solving similar problems in the future
