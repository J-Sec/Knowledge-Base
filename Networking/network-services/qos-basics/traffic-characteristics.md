Real-Time Protocol (RTP) on UDP port ranges 16384 to 32767 can be used to prioritise voice traffic



## Video

The number and size of video packets will vary greatly every 33ms:

There are two main factors that a network administrator needs to ask about the flow of data traffic:

* Does the data come from an interactive application?
* Is the data mission critical?
