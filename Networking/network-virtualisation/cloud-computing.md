# Cloud Computing

{% hint style="info" %}
<mark style="color:blue;">**Cloud computing**</mark> is the delivery of on-demand computing resources and services, such as storage, applications, and processing power, over the internet on a pay-as-you-go basis.
{% endhint %}

## Cloud Services

#### Software as a Service (SaaS)

* Cloud provider is responsible for access to applications and services, such as email, communication, and Office 365 that are delivered over the internet
* User does not manage any aspect of the cloud services except for limited user-specific application settings
* User only needs to provide their data

#### Platform as a Service (PaaS)

* Cloud provider is responsible for providing users access to the development tools and services used to deliver the applications
* Users are typically programmers and may have control over the configuration settings of the cloud provider’s application hosting environment

#### Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

* Cloud provider is responsible for giving IT managers access to the network equipment, virtualised network services, and supporting network infrastructure
* Allows IT managers to deploy and run software code, which can include operating systems and applications

## Cloud Models

#### Public Cloud

* Cloud-based applications and services offered in a public cloud are made available to the general population.&#x20;
* Services may be free or are offered on a pay-per-use model, such as paying for online storage.&#x20;
* The public cloud uses the internet to provide services.

#### Private Cloud

* Cloud-based applications and services offered in a private cloud are intended for a specific organisation or entity, such as the government.&#x20;
* A private cloud can be set up using the organisation’s private network, though this can be expensive to build and maintain. A private cloud can also be managed by an outside organisation with strict access security.

#### Hybrid Cloud

* A hybrid cloud is made up of two or more clouds (example: part private, part public), where each part remains a separate object, but both are connected using a single architecture.&#x20;
* Individuals on a hybrid cloud would be able to have degrees of access to various services based on user access rights.

#### Community Clouds

* A community cloud is created for exclusive use by a specific community.&#x20;
* The differences between public clouds and community clouds are the functional needs that have been customised for the community.
* For example, healthcare organisations must remain compliant with policies and laws (e.g., HIPAA) that require special authentication and confidentiality.
